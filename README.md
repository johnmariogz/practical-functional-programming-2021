# Practical Functional Programming

###### Code University 2021


## Session 2
- Higher-Order Functions
- Partially Applied Functions
- Pattern Matching
- Recursion

## Session 3
- Monads and its uses
  - `Option` (Scala)
  - `Try` (Scala)
  - `Either` (Scala)
- Concurrency and parallel computations
  - Mutability and concurrency dangers
  - Parallel data structures
  - Eventual Computations

## Session 4
- Handling state functionally
  - Naive Example vs. Monadic Approach (pros & cons)
- Advanced Concurrency in Functional Programming
  - Actors as simple use case
  - Actors in real world
- Monad Transformers
  - Using `OptionT` to extend the `FakeBlog` case
  - Using `EitherT` to handle information about what went wrong with `FakeBlog`
